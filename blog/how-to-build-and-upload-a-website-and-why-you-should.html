<h1>Build and Upload a Website.</h1>
<em>April 7, 2022</em>
<h2>Learn HTML and CSS basics</h2>
First of all, choose a good text editor, personally I use <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim.git">vim</a>/<a href="https://neovim.io">neovim</a>, It's available in linux, windows and mac, you can use VScode instead, but it's extremely bloated and slow. <br>
Now, you have to see these 2 videos until the end!, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJadKSKA7Mg&t=6s">LukeSmith's video</a> (enough to build a simple personal website) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlxWf493en4">FreeCompCode video</a> (Her voice is unbeatable lol). <br>
<p>After making the first web page, you have to make a blog, to make a blog you have many options like Hugo, Jekyll and many others. Personally I use <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb blog system</a>, It's a very lightweight 80 SLOC bash script, I have customized it to suit my website style, I like it but if you are a newbie, you may want to use something like Hugo or Jakyll.</p>
<p>Note: Know that you can take ideas from other websites, you can see HTML and CSS for any website in any browser.</p>
<br>
<h2>Upload the website</h2>
<p>You have to create a <a href="https://github.com">github</a> account, then create a repo and name it "YOURWEBSITENAME.github.io" and check "Add a README file" box. <br> Now upload index.html and other website files you just made to the repo. <br>
then type "YOURWEBSITENAME.github.io" in the url bar and boom! Your website is online now for free.
<p>Note: if you didn't understand this part just type "Github Pages" in Youtube and you will find ton of videos about that, and remember to replace "YOURWEBSITENAME" with the name of your website.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why you should have a website ?</h2>
<p>As you know, neoliberal and capitalist organizations and companies fully control all social media platforms. They do not allow any opinion that opposes liberal ideas, whether political or social, or even questions them. Then they will be banned, as happens to many every second, even the 43rd President of the United States get permanent banned after questioning American democracy.</p>
<p>Companies like "Facebook, Google, etc" are collacting our data and sell it for govs and organizations, So they know everything about us without having to resort to the Federal Intelligence Service and its spy services, and this threatens our national and geopolitical security. </p>
<p>Death is a theological imperative, so I think it's a good idea to put a memento after your death, something like a book or a website with your memoirs and articles.</p>
